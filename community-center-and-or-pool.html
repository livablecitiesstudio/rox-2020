            <section id="background">
                <h3>Background and Community Conversation</h3>
                <p>central community center or pool was a common theme throughout the planning process. A community
                    center, pool, and gathering place were identified as highly desired amenities. Based on the
                    feedback, residents believe a pool and community building provides an attractive amenity for all
                    ages. Currently, residents must travel 30 minutes or more to Foothills Recreation Centers, where the
                    RVMD subsidizes rates so that District residents can pay in district rates like Foothills residents.
                    After 30 years of development, RVMD is just about fully built out, leaving limited space for a new
                    facility like a community center or pool. The analysis of the sites was conducted to determine
                    potential locations for a new building with additional space for parking, access to utilities and
                    main roads, and connections to the trail network. The analysis indicated that there is not a clear
                    choice, but the following sites were identified as potential locations to be studied as a part of
                    the future feasibility study.</p>

            <section id="considerations">
                <h3>Considerations and Potential Locations</h3>
                <p>An in-depth analysis was conducted to determine potential location for a new community center and
                    pool. The analysis included a preliminary evaluation of property owned by the District with enough
                    space and infrastructure to accommodate a 2-4-acre area for a building, pool, parking, access and
                    opportunities for utility connections. Since RVMD is almost 100% built out and a specific site was
                    not set aside in the original planning for a facility this size, only two locations were possible
                    within the District. Other offsite locations were also considered but they pose another set of
                    challenges that may limit their feasibility. The potential sites and areas for consideration
                    include:</p>
                <h4>1. Community Park</h4>
                <p>The area in the Community Park just to the south of the parking lot is a potential location large
                    enough to accommodate a new facility with good access to roads and the trail network. Site
                    observations include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good location in the heart of the community with spectacular views and great access.</li>
                    <li>Provides additional activities and a destination in the Community Park</li>
                    <li>Existing utility connections nearby</li>
                    <li>Would require the demolition and/or redesign of the basketball court, existing pavilion and
                        trails near Rampart Ridge Road.</li>
                    <li>Grading, slope and soils will need additional evaluation</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/community park aerial.png" loading="lazy" alt="ommunity park aerial">
                    <p class="img-caption">Community Park as potential location for community center and/or pool</p>
                </div>
                <h4>2. Open Space South of Safeway</h4>
                <p>The open space area just south of Safeway also has the potential to accommodate a facility. Another
                    central location along the major open space spine, the site can benefit from proximity to the
                    commercial area and provide an amenity in a convenient location that is already a destination. Site
                    observations include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Good convenient location next to the existing commercial center with existing parking and trail
                        access points</li>
                    <li>Provides additional activities and another destination in the commercial center</li>
                    <li>Would likely require the coordination with commercial center to potentially address parking and
                        access.</li>
                    <li>Existing utility connections nearby</li>
                    <li>Grading, slope and soils will need additional evaluation</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Other Sites in the Community but not Owned by RVMD</h4>
                <p>There is the potential to look at other sites within the District that are not currently owned or
                    controlled by the District. These sites include undeveloped property near the intersection of
                    Waterton Road and areas along Rampart Range Road. Although these sites offer potential locations for
                    a new facility due to their location and proximity to District’s residents, the lack of ownership by
                    the District presents a challenge that would need to be addressed through land acquisition or
                    potential expansion of the District’s boundary. Due to the complexity of these sites and the
                    uncertainties related to property ownership, none of these sites were evaluated for the initial
                    studies. Going forward, the District may decide to study these sites as a part of the subsequent
                    feasibility study.</p>

            <section id="scenarios">
                <h3>Community Center and Pool Scenarios for Consideration</h3>
                <p>The size and programming of a potential pool and/or community center will require additional study
                    and discussions with the community. Three potential combinations of pool and community center
                    facilities have been discussed. Due to the complexity of the facility, the master plan documented
                    multiple scenarios so additional studies can be completed as a part of a recommended feasibility
                    study in 2020. </p>
                <h4>1. Pool with a Small Building</h4>
                <p>This scenario emphasizes the pool and only provides a small or medium sized building for seasonal
                    use. Potential program includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medium or large sized pool </li>
                    <li>Building with bathroom and changing room</li>
                    <li>Small community space or great room</li>
                    <li>Outdoor seating</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/pool1.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example of pool with a small building">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of pool with a small building</p>
                </div>
                <h4>2. Pool and Full Community Center</h4>
                <p>This scenario includes a pool and a full community center with space for weekly programs, services,
                    and activities. This scenario would likely require partnerships with other organizations to achieve.
                    Potential program includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medium or large sized pool</li>
                    <li>Full community center with various programs and activities</li>
                    <li>Weight room, gym or other active fitness spaces</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/pool2.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example of pool and full community center">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of pool and full community center</p>
                </div>
                <h4>3. Splash Pad and Full Community Center (No Pool)</h4>
                <p>This scenario is the same as Scenario 2 but replaces the pool with a splash pad. It would also
                    require partnerships with other organizations. Potential program includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive splash pad </li>
                    <li>Full community center with various programs and activities</li>
                    <li>Weight room, gym or other active fitness spaces</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/pool3.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example of splash pad and full community center (no pool)">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of splash pad and full community center (no pool)</p>
                </div>
                <h4>4. Full Community Center (no pool)</h4>
                <p>This scenario emphasizes the community center and does not include a pool or splash pad. Similar to
                    Scenarios 2 and 3, this would require partnerships with other organizations. Potential program
                    includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full community center with various programs and activities</li>
                    <li>Potential weight room, gym or other active fitness spaces</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/pool4.png" loading="lazy" alt="Example of full community center (no pool)">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of full community center (no pool)</p>

            <section id="recommendations">
                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <p>Based on the community’s desire for a new facility and the need for additional project feasibility
                    study, the recommendation is to proceed with an additional community center/pool feasibility study
                    in 2020. The feasibility study will continue the conversation with the community and conduct a
                    comprehensive feasibility analysis of the potential sites, partnerships, programs and costs. </p>
                <p>Due to the complexity of the project, the subsequent feasibility study will allow enough time to
                    thoroughly evaluate the feasibility of the project, including exploring financing scenarios and
                    partnerships to assist with operations and programming.</p>
