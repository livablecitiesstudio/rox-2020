            <h1>Implementation Strategy</h1>
            <section id="approach">
                <h3>Implementation Approach</h3>
                <p>RVMD has many tools available that can be used to implement several of the recommendations in this
                    plan. The annual budget is managed effectively, and the District is in a good position to maintain
                    existing assets and work through phased implementation over the next 10+ years, including
                    incremental improvements to trails, open space, neighborhood parks and annual maintenance needs.
                    However, as an outcome of the planning process and based on community input, there are a couple of
                    major needs and considerations that would likely require new tax revenue. The major areas of need
                    identified by the community include: 1) new community center and/or pool and 2) major enhancements
                    and upgrades to Little Willow Creek and the large ponds.</p>
                <p>The implementation strategy is organized to allow the District to phase implementation on an annual
                    basis. Envisioned as a working advisory document, the implementation section provides a tool to
                    plan, act and monitor phases of implementation over time. </p>
                <p>Due to the complexity of implementation and the community’s desire to see improvements immediately
                    while following through on the long-term vision of the plan, the implementation strategy is broken
                    down into three main phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“Quick Wins”</li>
                    <li>Short-term</li>
                    <li>Mid-term</li>
                    <li>Long-term</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Phase 1</h4>
                <p>Phase 1 implementation includes “Quick Wins” and Short-term projects that can be completed in a
                    1-3-year timeframe. </p>
                <h5>“Quick Win” Projects include:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>New Community Events in the Community Park</li>
                    <li>Additional of paved sidewalks on paths created by residents</li>
                    <li>Softball Field Improvements</li>
                    <li>Imperial Park Improvements</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Short-term Projects include:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improve crossings at Village Circle West</li>

                    <li>Access to ponds</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Phase 2</h4>
                <p>Phase 2 implementation includes Mid-term projects that can be completed in a 4-5-year timeframe. </p>
                <h5>Mid-term Project include:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connection to Chatfield State Park</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Phase 3</h4>
                <p>Phase 3 implementation includes Long-term projects that can be completed in a 5 or more-year
                    timeframe. Due to the large size and scope, a number of the Long-term projects will take multiple
                    years to plan, design and implement. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New trails at Hogback Ridge</li>

                <h3>Maintenance and Ongoing Service Needs</h3>
                <p>District maintenance of the parks and open space assets is essential to facilitate the evolution of
                    the RVMD as a premier location for living and celebrating the outdoor lifestyle of Colorado. </p>
                    
                    <p>Ongoing maintenance increases property values as well as provides safety and security to the
                    residents. Annual O&M (Operations and Maintenance) costs include planning, design, and
                    implementation, programs, communications and community outreach, administrative and finance,
                    recreation, property ownership and stormwater facility management. These functions are essential to
                    achieving the long-term vision both in implementing this plan and maintaining the integrity of the
                    vision in the future.</p>

                <h3>Capital Costs</h3>
                <p>Capital costs are the one-time, up-front costs to design and construct the major amenities or
                    improvements in the plan. This implementation plan includes only prioritized projects identified in
                    the recommendations. Although additional improvements may be contemplated after this plan is
                    complete, for the purposes of projecting capital costs, we have chosen to prioritize the major
                    improvements based on community and Board input.</p>

                <h3>Master Plan Recommended Capital Investments</h3>
                <p>Over the next 15 years, the recommended enhancements to RVMD will result in better open space, trails
                    and connectivity, neighborhood parks, recreational facilities, new programs and the potential for a
                    new community facility.</p>
                <p>The Capital Investments are broken into three phases: </p>
                <p>Phase 1 - Near term projects amounting to an estimated $1.6 million in capital improvements</p>
                <p>Phase 2 - Medium term projects amounting to an estimated $1.84 million in capital improvements</p>
                <p>Phase 3 - Long term projects amounting to an estimated $9 million in capital improvements</p>
                <p>Phase 1 includes short-term and quick-win projects. These are projects that have already been
                    completed or for which the District can use the current annual budget model to complete the work.
                    Both Phase 2 and 3 would likely require a public vote by District residents to approve an increase in property taxes in order to raise the funds necessary for implementation. </p>
                <p>In all cases, other than the potential community center and/pool facility, recommendations in this
                    plan can be scaled or modified to work within the budget parameters determined by the Board and
                    District residents. Depending on the scope and magnitude of the improvement, implementation may take
                    longer but the project can still proceed and deliver on the recommendations set forth in the plan.
