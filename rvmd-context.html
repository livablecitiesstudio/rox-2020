            <h1>RVMD Context</h1>
            <section id="today">
                <h3>Current Context Map</h3>
                <p>RVMD is a 959 acre District, and home to over 6,000 residents. Roxborough Park is neighbor to
                    Roxborough Village and a separately funded entity, though their residents do use Roxborough Village
                    schools, commercial areas, and recreation facilities. With close proximity to two state parks, the
                    regional High Line Canal trail, Waterton Canyon, and the Rocky Mountains, the RVMD is known for its
                    community, nature, and wildlife. </p>
                <p>The District has been fairly isolated since its establishment, however, the District and its
                    surrounding experience could change with new adjacent master planned communities in the near future.
                    It is important for the District to stay proactive in maximizing recreational opportunities for
                    residents and to plan ahead for the future.</p>

                <h3>Future Context Map</h3>
                <p>With full build-out of two major new master planned communities, Sterling Ranch and Solstice, RVMD
                    will face an influx of new homes and facilities. </p>
                <p>At its completion, Sterling Ranch will encompass 3,400 acres and anticipates to have approximately
                    33,000 residents over the next twenty years. Solstice is a 383 acres development with 1,100 new
                    homes planned. </p>
                <p>Sterling Ranch will ultimately provide a wide array of amenities, including a mixed use office /
                    retail town center, Civic Center, Rec Center, park and lake, extensive 30 miles trail system, and 4
                    new schools.</p>
                <p>With the addition of its new neighbors, the District faces pressure to stay competitive in the
                    housing market, and the need to re-evaluate its amenities and facilities for the residents. </p>
