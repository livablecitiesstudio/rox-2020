            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <section id="id"> 
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The small-town rural feel and the tight-knit community are the main appeals for RVMD but, the aging
                    parks and dated facilities present a challenge for the community to overcome. Trends in parks, open
                    space, and amenities have shifted since the community was master planned in the mid 1980’s. And
                    although some modifications to parks and programming have been made over time, the way in which
                    people use parks and open spaces today really has changed from their traditional functions. While
                    fields and various sports courts are still common, new programmed spaces are more frequently
                    integrated into park design. Opportunities for performance areas, open markets/ halls, and outdoor
                    gathering spaces, are now commonplace for hosting community gatherings and events. And in Colorado,
                    the desire to enjoy our outdoor lifestyle has only grown. Coloradans are seeking more ways to
                    experience our beautiful climate and get immersed in nature while being close to their home.</p>
                <h4>Current Programming and Events</h4>
                <p>The history of the District’s involvement in programming and events is very limited. Other than the
                    recent 2019 Fall Festival, which featured a community fireworks display, there have been very few
                    community-wide programs or events led by the District. This may be a new area of responsibility for
                    the District.</p>
                <h4>New Programming Opportunities</h4>
                <p>Based on community feedback, residents expressed a desire both to modernize the physical character of
                    the smaller neighborhood parks, and to support new programming that provides additional events and
                    activities not currently offered. Although this would be a new area of responsibility for the
                    District, it would address a community need and provide an expanded range of outdoor activities and
                    events. The general recommendations related to programming include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establishing an annual goal to expand activities and programs offered to residents, since there
                        is a strong demand for the District to organize and provide financial support for seasonal
                        events and/or festivals.</li>
                    <li>Continue to offer programming opportunities that started in 2019, including the continuation of
                        the fall festival, while planning and budgeting for other programs such as open-air market,
                        fairs, or potential community concerts.</li>
                    <li>Explore opportunities to partner with other organizations or institutions on events or
                        activities that are supported and desired by the community.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="community-park-programming">
                <h3>Programming for the Community Park</h3>
                <p>New community events and programs in the community park can provide seasonal and periodic programming
                    activities to support the community’s desire for more activities for families, youth, and all
                    residents. In addition to the recently implemented Fall Festival, the District should consider park
                    programming including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organizing more festivals, in addition to the Fall Festival, based on community input and
                        desires. Some potential festivals can be organized around various themes like kites or hot air
                        balloons, cultural, arts or craft fairs, etc. </li>
                    <li>Organizing and arranging a potential local farmer’s market like others throughout the region.
                        These typically require partnerships with organizers who regularly run and coordinate farmer’s
                        markets.</li>
                    <li>Consider hosting summer concerts or outdoor movies, including a potential summer series. Any new
                        programming or concert should be coordinated with Arrowhead Shores HOA and their existing summer
                        concert series.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="active-events">
                <h3>Active Events and Programs within the Trails and Open Space</h3>
                <p>The trail and open space network provide an opportunity for community events that promote health,
                    wellness and active lifestyles. Events utilize the open space and can highlight Roxborough’s
                    beautiful natural setting. Potential programming includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organized runs, walks and other events supporting various community organizations, such as 5k or
                        10k walk/runs or cross-country running events. This includes pursuing a sanctioned 5k or 10k run
                        that can become a potential regional event. </li>
                    <li>Annual youth fishing derby or day with representatives from local outdoor organizations.</li>
                    <li>Outdoor yoga.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="additional-programs">
                <h3>Additional Programs and Activities with Other Partners</h3>
                <p>Other programs and activities are possible through creative partnerships with other organizations and
                    facilities. Potential programs and activities include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Day camps, or youth and teen recreation clubs.</li>
                    <li>Senior recreational clubs and organized activities.</li>
                    <li>Arts and crafts for children.</li>
                    <li>Aerobic fitness for youth and adults.</li>
                    <li>Strength and flexibility training classes or seminars.</li>
