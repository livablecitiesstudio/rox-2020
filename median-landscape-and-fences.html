            <h1>Median Landscape and Fences</h1>
            <section id="median">
                <h3>Median & Edge Landscape</h3>
                <p>The median and edge landscape create continuous visual landscape character along all the streets and
                    major roadways in RVMD. </p>
                <h4>Rampart Range Road</h4>
                <p>With most of the District’s visitors coming from the north and entering the District through Rampart
                    Range Rd, northern medians along Rampart Range provide a great opportunity to instill a positive
                    first impression to the visitors, and to speak to the District’s brand as a natural and small-town
                    community.</p>
                <p>Careful treatment and intentional plant materials in the median landscape can help craft user
                    experience on the road as visitors enter the District, and this can work as a quick-win for the
                    District to implement.</p>
                <p>Based on community feedback, residents are satisfied with the current state of the median and edge
                    landscape in RVMD. Medians are generally in good condition and do not have major renovation needs.
                    The current median holiday lighting program has been very successful and should be continued. </p>
                <p>The median along Roxborough Primary School currently has a healthy mix of plants, with different
                    plant massing and colors that provide interest along Rampart Range Rd. However, medians at the
                    northern segment of Rampart Range Road are sparse and mostly covered with gravels and crusher fines.
                </p>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/median planting example.png" alt="median planting example">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of median planting</p>
                </div>
                <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                <p>Consider adding large plant clusters throughout the Rampart Range Rd median. Due to fast car
                    traveling speeds along the road, large clusters of woody shrubs, tall grasses, and trees can help
                    create a sense of place and provide visual interest to the users. Considering the width of the road
                    and vastness of the contextual landscape, planting clusters should be at least 5ft to 10ft wide, and
                    at least 30ft to 40ft long to provide substantial visual impact to the vehicular users. Use of
                    native plants in road medians will conserve water use.</p>

                <h4>Edge landscape along Village Circle East and Village Circle West</h4>
                <p>Edge landscape is defined as the landscape between fences and curb line within neighborhoods. Edge
                    landscape width and dimension vary depending on the location and may require different design
                    strategies in different locations. </p>
                <p>Most of the edge landscaping along Village Circle West and Village Circle East is currently in good
                    condition, with bluegrass turf as the dominant landscape. Southern segment of Village Circle East
                    does not contain any groundcover and is covered with gravels. Consider converting bluegrass turf and
                    gravel to native plant species to provide visual interest and conserve water needs.</p>
                <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                <p>In addition to continuing current maintenance regime, the District can look for opportunities to
                    reduce bluegrass turf areas and increase native landscape areas to mitigate maintenance needs and
                    water use.</p>
                <p>Consider phasing in enhanced landscape and plantings using native plants. At key intersections, such
                    as Rampart Range Rd and Village Circle East, the District has installed native plants and perennials
                    to signify entrance into the neighborhoods. Some intersection patches remain empty and covered in
                    gravels, such as northern intersection between Rampart Range Rd and Village Circle West. Consider
                    adding enhanced landscape featuring xeric and native plants to signal entrances into the
                    neighborhoods.</p>
                <p>When replanting or installing enhancements, arrange plants in large masses to reflect the scale of
                    the road and create a visual effect for drivers passing by at higher speeds.</p>

                <h4>Enhanced Signage and Seasonal Lighting in Key Locations</h4>
                <p>Use flowering perennials and shrubs to accentuate major intersections and entry signs. Include
                    planting colors as wayfinding signals and to further enhance the District’s natural brand.</p>
                <p>Continue to use large slabs of rocks that reflect the hogback geology as signage and as visual
                    features at key locations.</p>
                <p>Use seasonal lightings in the medians to celebrate special holidays and events. Install new
                    programmable lights that can change for different seasonal events and effects.</p>

            <section id="fencing">
                <h3>Fencing</h3>
                <p>Currently, there are a total of 6 HOAs within the District. Not all HOAs have active governing
                    Boards. Each HOA implements different fence styles, resulting in inconsistent fencing along Rampart
                    Range Rd, the main vehicular road through the District. </p>
                <p>In addition, years after initial installment, the fences experienced normal wear and tear, causing
                    fencing qualities to vary greatly from segment to segment due to the different maintenance regime
                    from different neighborhoods and HOAs. </p>
                <p>Based on site observations, neighborhoods without active HOAs tend to have more variety in their
                    fencing. </p>

                <h5>Recommendations</h5>
                <p>The various fencing presents incoherent identity to the people visiting the District. In order to
                    provide consistent and strong District identity, the master plan recommends planting woody and
                    perennial species in front of fences to provide consistency throughout the area. Consider working
                    with HOAs and non-active HOA tracts along Rampart Range Rd to install similar family of fencing
                    styles. </p>
                <p>The following map and images illustrate existing fencing conditions and active HOAs within the
                    District. </p>

                        <p>Fencing varies by individual properties. It will be difficult to coordinate consistent
                            fencing with individual property owners. Recommend using woody shrubs in front of fences to
                            provide a consistent entrance experience.</p>
