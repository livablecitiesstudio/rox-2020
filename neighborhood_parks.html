            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <p>The neighborhood parks in RVMD offer playgrounds and small outdoor areas for children in each of the
                various neighborhoods. Set within the various neighborhoods, the parks provide walkable access for
                families and children and more intimate spaces with playgrounds. Analysis of the parks and community
                feedback indicate the parks are somewhat outdated with older equipment that is not suitable for a wide
                variety of age groups. Additionally, the parks all share a consistent character and similar play
                equipment. Due to age and the need to upgrade several of the park features, there is an opportunity to
                modernize the parks with new forms of play elements, shade and seating so the parks can become
                celebrated amenities in each neighborhood. General recommendations and goals related to neighborhood
                parks include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reinforce the role of each neighborhood park as an amenity destination for the various neighborhoods
                    in RVMD</li>
                <li>Explore improvements that provide play structure for different age groups. </li>
                <li>Provide more options for ADA access around play structures for children with disabilities. </li>
                <li>Strengthen the identity of each park to create a variety of experiences for residents.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1. Chatfield Farms Park </h3>
            <p>The park, located on the northernmost edge of the Little Willow Creek open space, provides the largest
                multi-use field space, a small playground, and a seating area with parking. The park serves the broader
                community as well as the immediate neighborhoods due to the combination of the multi-use field space and
                small playground area. The multi-use field was a successful addition to the park as an outcome of the
                2010 Master Plan. Due to recent improvements to the play structure , and due to upkeep of the fields and
                other areas, the basic condition of the park is in good shape and does not need any major improvements.
                Beyond the continuation of basic annual improvements, recommendations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop an overall character for the park that reinforces its location near the active multi-use
                    field, such as play elements with a sports theme. This can be implemented over time by replacing
                    older park elements with new features that support a sports theme and character.</li>
                <li>Replace the existing picnic tables with a consistent site furnishings package that match the overall
                    park and open space standards included in this document. </li>
                <li>A specific recommended repair to the upper playground and parking area is the addition of a new
                    exterior finish to the existing wall by installing a wall cap and facade which will create more
                    comfortable seating opportunities. </li>
            </ul>
