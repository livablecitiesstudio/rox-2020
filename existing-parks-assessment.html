                <h4>Parks</h4>
                <p>The District currently consists of one large community park, which serves all residents of the
                    District, and six neighborhood parks scattered throughout the District that provide smaller
                    amenities to their closely adjacent homes. Neighborhood parks mostly contain a playground for small
                    children and some seating areas. The parks in the District all have different styles of furnishings
                    and play equipment for singular age groups, and limited access for children with disabilities.</p>
                <p>East District has a total of 4 neighborhood parks: Crystal Lake Park, Mule Deer Park, Airplane Park
                    and Marmot Ridge Park. Crystal Lake Park and Mule Deer Park are owned by Arrowhead Shores HOA,
                    whereas Airplane Park and Marmot Ridge Park are owned by the District. </p>
                <p>West District has Imperial Park that is owned by the District, and Northern District has Chatfield
                    Farms Park that belongs to Chatfield Farms 1A HOA. While some neighborhood parks are not under
                    direct ownership of the District, the District has formed agreements with the HOAs to maintain all
                    parks in RVMD. </p>
                <p class="footnote">Site visit and evaluations were conducted in the Spring of 2019 as part of the master plan process.
                    Each park element is ranked on a 3 star system.</p>
