            <section id="irrigation">
                <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                <p>The irrigation system in Roxborough Village is supported by water supplied by the Roxborough Park
                    Metropolitan District that is then stored in the 7-acre pond and used for irrigation purpose
                    throughout the District. Due to the extent and complexity of the irrigation system, the District
                    conducts annual assessments to identify and address maintenance needs. </p>
                <p>The District retained the services of Hydrosystems KDI to conduct a full review of all irrigation
                    controllers on site to determine their condition and confirm the number of zones on each controller.
                    The evaluation includes meetings with the District’s maintenance contractor and District’s
                    management representative to review the problem areas, confirm issues and repair needs and determine
                    maintenance cost of repairs to each location. </p>
                <p>Hydrosystems KDI will provide written report summarizing their evaluation and prioritizing areas for
                    future phased improvement needs based on their evaluation of the condition of the existing
                    irrigation controllers and systems, repair costs and potential cost savings following upgrades. </p>
                <p>Refer to the Hydrosystems KDI report included in the appendix of this document for additional
                    information.</p>

            <section id="maintenance">
                <h3>Maintenance Strategies</h3>
                <p>Maintenance of the District occurs on an annual basis in four primary categories: Landscape, Snow
                    Removal, Irrigation, and General Repairs & Replacement. As an important part of the annual
                    activities and budgeting, maintenance activities are managed and undertaken throughout the year
                    during the seasonal windows for each category. To prevent excessive maintenance costs, the District
                    Board regularly evaluates maintenance needs and methods to develop cost-effective approaches that
                    works within the annual budget parameters and sustains a well-maintained open space system. </p>
                <p>For the purposes of the Master Plan, the following category summary and recommendations have been
                    developed to inform maintenance discussions and budget decisions. In addition, the material included
                    herein, maintenance budget projections have been included in Implementation Strategy (p. 93) section
                    of this document. </p>
                <h4>Landscape</h4>
                <p>Landscape and tree care have been consistently maintained over the years to retain the high-quality
                    planting throughout the District, and modifications have been made to the original design to reduce
                    the maintenance and irrigation needs.
                    Annual seasonal activities include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tree Pruning and touch up around sidewalks, streets and dead tree removal due to storm damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Deep Root Fertilization except fruit trees and cottonwoods. This typically occurs once in
                        March-April and once in Sept-October. </li>
                    <li>Conifer Protection Program to treat spruces and pines for Mountain Pine Beetle, Ips Beetle,
                        Zimmerman Pine Moth, and Spruce Gall, which typically includes three treatments in March-April,
                        June-July, and again in August-September. </li>
                    <li>Targeted general Spray Program on selected trees for aphids, mites, caterpillars, and leaf
                        feeding beetles. The trees treated depend on the pest present. The program typically includes
                        three treatments done in April-May, June-July, and August-September. </li>
                    <li>Emerald Ash Borer Trunk Injection where all ash trees are trunk injected with Arbormectin
                        (Ammamectin Benzoate) for Emerald Ash Borer, Lilac Ash Borer, Redheaded Ash Borer, and Ash Bark
                        Beetle. This treatment is typically done from April-June after leaf emergence and lasts two
                        years. </li>
                    <li>Warranty Tree Planting which replaces trees that did not survive from the previous year.
                        Planting typically takes place in March-April.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Based on budget tracking over a 10-year period, the annual maintenance budget averages approximately
                    $280,000. This includes maintenance for all general landscape areas, weed control, and tree
                    maintenance, spraying and replacement.</p>
                <p>As reflected in the Implementation Strategy section, the District should maintain this level of
                    maintenance and plan for an increase in maintenance costs due to annual escalation. </p>

                <h4>Irrigation</h4>
                <p>The irrigation system used to water and sustain the plants is one of the most complicated maintenance
                    areas due to the extent of the piping, plumbing, pumps and overall system controls required to keep
                    the system running effectively. Conversely, snow removal needs, which are much less complicated,
                    vary year to year based on snowfall and weather conditions. Lastly, general repairs and replacement
                    of District assets include the neighborhood parks and playgrounds, benches, trash receptacles and
                    any other repairs required to retain high-quality equipment in the open space areas and recreational
                    facilities within the District. </p>
