                <h3>Recommendations</h3>

                    <p class="img-caption">RVMD trail network</p>
                </div>

                <p>The trails and connectivity provide direct access to nature and promote walking, running, biking and
                    enjoying the outdoors. The community process confirmed that the trails and connectivity are one of
                    the most important amenities of the community. The continuous network provides the most significant
                    central feature of the community, links neighborhoods and reinforces the community’s position at the
                    foothills of the Hogbacks and Rocky Mountains. Survey results and feedback from the community
                    reinforced the importance of the trails and open space network as the heart and ‘main street’ of the
                    community.</p>
                <p>In addition to general maintenance and enhancements, the main areas of need identified by the
                    community included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved regional connections, such as access to Chatfield State Park, Roxborough State Park and
                        the High Line Canal Trail.</li>
                    <li>Improve trail network segments and pedestrian crossings in key locations to support walking and
                        biking throughout the community.</li>
                    <li>Continued trail improvements to keep the network in good condition and adding new connections in
                        key locations to gain access to community destinations and amenities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Connections to Waterton Canyon, Chatfield State Park and Roxborough State Park</h3>
                <p>Although the trail network within the Little Willow Creek open space is well connected and
                    continuous, connections north to regional amenities and trails are lacking. To address this, new
                    multi-use trail connections for bikes and pedestrians should be completed so residents can have safe
                    and easy access to Chatfield State Park, Waterton Canyon and other areas north. Since these
                    improvements are outside the purview of the District, the District should work with Douglas County,
                    the High Line Canal Conservancy and other partners to create a paved multi use path connection to
                    the canal and beyond. Specific trail connections include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterton Road/High Line Canal Connection - Improve pedestrian crossing by alerting approaching
                        vehicles with clear trail crossing signage, and potential traffic calming elements to slow down
                        traffic. </li>
                    <li>New multi-use trail along the south side of Waterton Road between Liverpool Circle and Campfire
                        Street. This trail would provide a new direct connection to the High Line Canal trail for
                        residents living in the northeast neighborhoods of RVMD. </li>
                    <li>New multi-use trail connection from the High Line Canal Trail along Waterton Road to Waterton
                        Canyon trailhead and parking area. This critical connection will create a continuous multi-use
                        trail from RVMD to two major amenities located to the north: Waterton Canyon and Chatfield State
                        Park. </li>
                    <li>Extending the bike lane or creating a multi-use trail on Rampart Range Rd that connects to
                        Roxborough State Park would provide a continuous network for residents to access the State Park
                        safely. Like connections north, the new trail or bike lane cannot be achieved solely by the
                        District and will require coordination and joint partnering connection with Douglas County or
                        Roxborough State Park or others.</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="crossings">
                <h3>Improved Pedestrian and Bike Crossings on Major Roads</h3>
                <p>Improving pedestrian and bike crossings on major roads will promote greater use of the trail network
                    and encourage more use by all residents, especially children and youth. The community already has
                    some crossings along Rampart Range Road, Village Circle West and Waterton Road. However, crossing
                    enhancements and new crossings will improve overall connectivity and safety throughout the
                    community.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New Crossing at Village Circle West and Westside Street – The intersection currently includes
                        ramps on either side of the road but does not have any crossing markers or pedestrian signs.
                        Intersection improvements that add new crossing markings, pedestrian signs and potential
                        pedestrian-activated crossing signal would create better crossing condition for residents
                        connecting to and from the open space trail network. </li>
                    <li>New Crossing at Village Circle West and Buckeye Street – The existing intersection only includes
                        ramps on the Buckeye Street side of the road. New intersection improvements that add new
                        crossing markings, pedestrian signs and potential pedestrian-activated crossing signal would
                        create better crossing conditions for residents connecting to and from the open space trail
                        network. </li>
                    <li>Improvements to the existing Village Circle West crossing between Westside St. and Buckeye St. –
                        Although the crossing is marked and has signage today, additional improvements including a
                        pedestrian-activated light, or a pedestrian speed table would slow traffic and promote
                        pedestrians continuing on the open space trail. Additionally, bollards or new open space signage
                        announcing Little Willow Creek would provide additional visual cues that indicate the importance
                        of the pedestrian crossing.</li>
                    <li>Improvements to existing crossings at N Rampart Range Rd and Village Cir E and Community Park -
                        Current crossings have pedestrian marking and pedestrian-activated signal. However, due to
                        higher speed on Rampart Range Rd, the crossings would benefit with additional pedestrian speed
                        tables to slow traffic down. </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="character-img">

            <section id="new-paths">
                <h3>New and Improved Paths</h3>
                <p>New and improved paths within the RVMD open space would provide additional connectivity and promote
                    more pedestrian and bicycle use by residents. The new and improved path recommendations are based on
                    field observations and feedback received from the community residents based on their use patterns
                    and knowledge of the trail system.</p>
                <h4>Additional Paved Sidewalks</h4>
                <p>Provide additional paved paths in areas where residents have created informal connections to
                    destinations based on frequency of use. </p>
                
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/paved sidewalk example.png" alt="paved sidewalk example">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of paved sidewalk</p>
                </div>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Village Circle West to Roxborough Primary School - Add new sidewalk connection from the south
                        side of the intersection of Village Circle West and the north side of Roxborough Primary School.
                        The sidewalk will replace an existing social path created by children and parents walking to
                        school and encourage more walkability. Due to the connection to the school, the project will
                        need to be coordinated with the Primary School and Douglas County School District. Due to the
                        slope and existing topography, the connection will likely require stairs and an evaluation for
                        ADA compliance.</li>
                    <li>Village Circle West between Telluride Place and North Rampart Range Road - Add new sidewalk
                        connection on northside of Village Circle West to provide continuous pedestrian experience.
                        Install attached sidewalk and make sure the new sidewalk aligns with sidewalk on west side of
                        Telluride Place.</li>
                    <li>Improved Path Connection from Rampart Range Road to Pine Hills Way – An existing social path
                        exists due to students walking to the Roxborough Intermediate School from neighborhoods on the
                        west side of Little Willow Creek open space. To promote more use and address connectivity to the
                        school, the path should be improved to a permanent soft path or concrete sidewalk. Due to
                        grading and slopes, the path route may need to be adjusted so it can be ADA compliant.</li>
                    <li>Roxborough Commons South Open Space – The existing paved trails in the linear open space south
                        of Safeway and the commercial shopping center provide a great connection and amenity for
                        residents wanting to walk to places such as the commercial center. After years of use, social
                        paths have been created by residents indicating the need for additional permanent paths that
                        reinforce resident needs. The area should be evaluated to confirm which paths should be improved
                        as either concrete walkways or stabilized crusher fine paths to provide a stable and reliable
                        path for residents. The following connections should be evaluated and improved:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connection from Silvercliff Lane to Existing Sidewalk - The new path will provide a
                                direct connection from the neighborhood south of the commercial center to the open space
                                and areas north. The connection can utilize an existing RVMD open space tract between
                                two homes and connect to the trail in the center of the open space.</li>
                            <li>Conversion of Social Paths to Concrete or Crusher Fines – Social paths in the open space
                                that have been created by residents should be evaluated to determine which paths can be
                                converted to a permanently stable surface.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>Continuous Soft Edge Path</h4>
                <p>The main trail network around Little Willow Creek remains in good condition and has been improved
                    over the years to provide a consistent multi use trail for the community. The addition of a
                    continuous soft edge along the main trail that loops around the primary Willow Creek space will
                    enhance the trail system and provide a softer surface for running and walking. The soft path can be
                    added to the edges of the existing concrete trail and run along the main loop around the central
                    open space, so users have the option to walk or exercise on a hard or soft surface. </p>
                <div class="character-img">
                    <img src="img/soft edge path example.png" alt="soft edge path example">
                    <p class="img-caption">Example of soft edge path</p>
                </div>
                <h4>Hogback Ridge Upper Trail</h4>
                <p>The Dakota Hogback is the dramatic geologic structure that frames the western edge of the RVMD open
                    space area. As a known upland wildlife corridor with a variety of vegetation types, the area
                    provides an opportunity for residents to access and explore the diverse upland species and native
                    plant communities. The 2006 Master Plan suggested the addition of a formalized soft surface trail,
                    and also the creation of a Habitat Conservation Area paired with trail improvements. The area
                    remains an invaluable natural and ecologic resource today. </p>
                <p>Based on community feedback, there is a desire by residents to have expanded options to experience
                    the Dakota Hogback with improved trails and signage. In addition to signage improvements at the main
                    access points, a new soft trail should be added from the access point just south of Jared Way and
                    connecting 1.25 miles north to Waterton Road. Since the area is not fully under the authority of
                    RVMD, a partnership and agreement with the owners of the mining property to the west is needed.</p>
                <div class="character-img">

                    <p class="img-caption">Photo of Dakota Hogback Ridge</p>
                </div>
                <h4>Minor Neighborhood Trails and Paths</h4>
                <p>In addition to the major trail and paths improvements, minor neighborhood connections should be
                    created that provide new short segments of improved paths to replace social trails and dirt paths
                    created by residents over the years. After decades of use by residents, dirt paths and shortcuts
                    have created areas where it is now appropriate to provide permanent paths and trails. These area
                    should be evaluated before improvements are completed to determine the appropriate trail type that
                    provides a stable surface and retains the character of the area, in some cases a soft trail using
                    crusher fines may be appropriate.</p>
