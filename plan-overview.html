            <h1>Plan Overview</h1>
            <section id="purpose">
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The Roxborough Village Master Plan serves as the guiding document for Roxborough Village Metropolitan
                    District (“RVMD” or “District”)* . The ultimate purpose of developing the Master Plan is to outline
                    the
                    vision for the open space, parks and other areas that are within the responsibility of RVMD. The
                    document
                    also outlines recommendations and priorities that will provide for both the community’s enjoyment
                    and
                    the
                    management of RVMD’s resources. The plan is advisory, only. </p>
                <p>The master plan provides a conceptual planning framework for setting management priorities and
                    provides
                    direction for RVMD resources. The master plan also:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Guides management of District assets related to open spaces, parks, programming, maintenance and
                        operations.</li>
                    <li>Provides a framework for maintaining and enhancing assets within RVMD. Serves as a guide for
                        future
                        budget allocations.</li>
                    <li>Implementation of the Roxborough Village Master Plan will assist the RVMD Board in their efforts
                        to
                        maintain and enhance RVMD amenities for existing and future residents. The Board will use the
                        master
                        plan as a working document to evaluate implementation progress during board meetings and on an
                        annually basis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="footnote">*”RVMD” or “District” refers to Roxborough Village Metropolitan District and its
                    residents . “Community” refers RVMD residents as well as the broader community outside the District
                    boundaries that call Roxborough area home.</p>

                <h3>Project Background</h3>
                <p>The District has been fairly isolated for the majority of its existence. Due to its geographic
                    isolation,
                    the District has enjoyed its quiet atmosphere as a foothill community. However, with the greater
                    Denver
                    metropolitan population growth and development expansion, two new master planned communities,
                    Sterling
                    Ranch and Solstice, will bring thousands of new residents and brand-new amenities to areas adjacent
                    to
                    the District. To stay proactive to the shifting market and to increase the overall market appeal of
                    the
                    District and community, the District initiated a planning process and started a community-wide
                    conversation on how the District residents want to move forward and further enhance the District’s
                    identity.</p>

            <section id="brief-overview">
                <h3>Brief Overview of Roxborough Village Metropolitan District</h3>
                <p>Formed in 1985, RVMD is a governmental entity that provides park and recreation, open space, and
                    streetscape improvements and maintenance. Douglas County is responsible for street and drainage
                    maintenance in RVMD. The District is governed by a Board of five Directors, elected by the residents
                    of
                    the District. The original developer formed the District to issue debt to pay for the District’s
                    community’s streets, utilities, parks, and other infrastructure, improvements and maintenance. </p>
                <p>Since its establishment in the mid-1980s, the District has refinanced its debt several times. The
                    first refinancing came in 1993 after residential lot sales plummeted due to the real estate crash of
                    the 1980s, forcing the District into bankruptcy. The next refinancing occurred in 2004 after the
                    inclusion and development of Chatfield Farms. The final refinance occurred in 2014. The bonds will
                    be fully paid off in December 2021. Residents have seen reductions in their property tax bills over
                    time as tax revenue projections have allowed, and once the debt has been paid in full the debt
                    service mill levy will be retired.</p>
                <p>The Board is focused on improving the District’s parks, open space, and recreational opportunities,
                    and
                    was excited to hear how residents wanted the District to grow in the future through the Master
                    Planning
                    Process. Through the process, residents were asked if they would like to see additional amenities in
                    the
                    District, such as a pool or community center, improved parks, better pond access, and open space
                    enhancements. </p>

            <section id="related-documents">
                <h3>Related Documents</h3>
                <p>The following list includes previous and relevant improvement and maintenance efforts. These
                    documents
                    have been evaluated to determine potential gaps and need for additional research and discussion.
                </p>
                <h4>2006 Parks and Open Space Renovation Master Plan: </h4>
                <p>In the resident questionnaire, residents desired improvements to streetscapes/entry signage and
                    landscaping along streets, and District residents were generally satisfied with existing trail
                    systems
                    and open space. The questionnaires identified recreational needs from the residents, such as
                    multi-use
                    athletic fields and athletic courts, but the master plan concluded there was no available land
                    suitable
                    for construction of these facilities without providing detailed reasoning. For the 2020 master plan,
                    additional feasibility studies may be needed if the residents demonstrate desire for recreational
                    facilities. </p>
                <h4>2010 Community Park Master Plan: </h4>
                <p>This Master plan prompted the addition of new amenities such as age separated playground, climbing
                    wall,
                    multi-use field, picnic shelters, boulder amphitheater, overlook deck, inline hockey rink with shade
                    structure, fishing dock, and park entrances signs. The plan also adjusted trail paths to meet
                    American
                    Disability Act (ADA) standards and provided additional trails for access and connection to various
                    programs throughout the park.</p>
                <h4>2014 Amended Service Plan: </h4>
                <p>The 2014 Amended Service Plan provided Estimated Costs and Phasing of Improvements for the next 15
                    years.
                    List of improvements include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replace and improve retaining wall at 7 Acres Pond</li>
                    <li>Implement streetscape design</li>
                    <li>Imperial Park improvements</li>
                    <li>Relocate volleyball court</li>
                    <li>Add entrance signs and park entry signs</li>
                    <li>Replace existing shelter at Community Park</li>
                    <li>Convert asphalt trail to concrete</li>
                    <li>Add distance markers to trails</li>
                    <li>Design and construct multi-use field, age separated playgrounds, shelters, disc golf and
                        climbing wall at Community Park</li>
                    <li>Add fitness course</li>
                    <li>Annual irrigation system maintenance and upgrade</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2018 Board Priorities Summary:</h4>
                <p>The board envisioned RVMD 2023 as a place for families, with more picnic areas and shade structures
                    for
                    social gatherings. The new Master Plan should capitalize and improve existing open space assets
                    while
                    maintaining the quiet atmosphere of the community. Such improvements include bettering access and
                    connectivity for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicular driver, and especially improve connections
                    from
                    opens spaces to schools.</p>
