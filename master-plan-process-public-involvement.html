            <h1>Master Plan Process & Public Involvement</h1>
            <section id="engagement-process">
                <h3>Engagement Process</h3>
                <p>The Master Plan Update Process occurred over an 8-10 month timeframe and included four phases of
                    activity: Analysis, Concepts, Draft Master Plan and Final Master Plan. The engagement process
                    included three community events, three online surveys and regular coordination with the RVMD Board.
                    The first public meeting was hosted at Community Park, and the second and third public meetings were
                    hosted at Roxborough Elementary School.</p>
                <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                <p>The planning team reached out to the community through three public meeting events, paired with
                    online surveys to allow community members who could not attend to give feedback.
                    In addition to traditional in-person public meetings and online surveys, each community event
                    featured an innovative outreach that is specifically designed for each stage of the planning
                    process, and provided residents an appropriate platform to give feedback that would guide the
                    planning recommendations to best serve community residents’ needs and desires. </p>
                <h4>Open Space Walk and Talk</h4>
                <p>The first public meeting featured an Open Space Walk and Talk. The Open Space Walk and Talk offered a
                    way for the community members to share ‘in the field’ information with each other and the planning
                    team. A member from the planning team led a group of community members on a short stroll around
                    Roxborough Community Park. Through informal conversations and occasional stopping points, community
                    members shared important feedback on what is working and not working in the open space system.</p>
                <h4>Interactive Game</h4>
                <p>The second public meeting asked residents to play an interactive game for planners to get feedback on
                    what kind of amenities in which residents want to invest.</p>
                <p>Residents received a ‘wallet’ of RoxBucks, and visited six stations to select their preferences. Each
                    station offered options for various community amenities, funding, and improvements, or the option to
                    withhold funding to keep parks the way they are today. </p>
                <p>The stations included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Little Willow Creek Greenway</li>
                    <li>Community Pool</li>
                    <li>Neighborhood Parks</li>
                    <li>Recreation</li>
                    <li>Programming</li>
                    <li>Trails and Connectivity</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Virtual Reality Tour</h4>
                <p>The third public meeting introduced preliminary detailed recommendations for each of the following
                    categories: trails & connectivity, open space, neighborhood parks, programming, recreation, and
                    potential community center and/or pool locations and scenarios. </p>
                <p>To demonstrate potential concept design for neighborhood parks, virtual options featured were play
                    equipments for different age groups, nature play, shade structure, grills, and seating areas. The
                    planning team set up a station to allow community members to tour the future park in virtual
                    reality. Virtual reality model allows community members to have a better understanding of what
                    potential neighborhood parks could look and feel like, and experience the park in real-time before
                    its built. </p>

                <h3>Community Meeting Feedback Summary</h3>
                <h4>Community Meeting 1 | May 18, 2019</h4>
                <p>The May kickoff event at the Community Park focused on listening and gathering some initial community
                    input. Residents were asked to provide input on their favorite and least favorite outdoor amenities
                    and open space locations, and to share ideas for new amenities, activities and events. For those not
                    able to attend, an online survey was made available.</p>
                <h5>Survey Summary</h5>
                <p>It was clear that residents of the community love their trails, open space, natural beauty, and
                    access to nature, but some believed a few things were lacking. Input received from the first
                    community meeting and the online survey revealed that 60% to 70% of respondents are satisfied with
                    the parks, open spaces, and streets.</p>
                <p>It was evident that a vast majority of respondents regularly use the trails along Little Willow Creek
                    and the adjacent parks. </p>
                <p>The 265 respondents expressed a strong desire for a pool or community center, water features, nature
                    playgrounds, and new programs, including a farmer’s market, and concerts in an outdoor amphitheater.</p>
                <p>Respondents also expressed interest in additional shade structures and a variety of play features for
                    all ages. The general theme was interest in programming and amenities that encourage social
                    gatherings, such as concerts, markets, and a potential pool.</p>

                <h4>Community Meeting 2 | September 5, 2019</h4>
                <p>The District hosted a second community meeting to get input. Residents’ input from the first
                    community meeting, as well as survey results, indicated the community’s interest in a pool, improved
                    playgrounds, enhanced open spaces, and new programs such as a potential farmer’s market or community
                    concerts. </p>
                <p>The September community meeting featured an interactive exercise where residents were asked to select
                    their preferences for community open space amenities. As part of the exercise, residents were asked
                    to decide if they wanted to invest in a new community pool, neighborhood parks, trail connections,
                    open spaces, and additional community events like the Fall Festival.
                    Turnout and feedback was fantastic and the second community survey received 590 responses, which was
                    a 100% increase from the first survey.</p>

                <h4>Community Meeting 3 | November 7, 2019</h4>
                <p>The District hosted the final community meeting in November. The meeting included results and
                    summaries from the first and second community surveys, draft recommendations for trail &
                    connectivity, open space, neighborhood parks, programming, recreation, and community center and/or
                    pool locations and scenarios.</p>
                <p>The community residents were asked to rank their level of agreement regarding each recommendation,
                    such as providing trail connection to Chatfield State Park, adding play equipment for various age
                    groups in neighborhood parks, and potential future community center and/or pool locations, so the
                    District Board could better gauge the community’s interests. </p>
                <p>The third community survey received 203 responses, and offered detailed glimpses into the
                    respondents’ desire regarding master plan recommendations. </p>
